// HappyNotes Account Pages - Now using main design system
// This file is kept minimal, most styling is in app.scss

@use 'variables' as *;
@use 'utilities' as *;
@use 'buttons' as *;
@use 'cards' as *;
@use 'forms' as *;

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

// Note: Account pages now use the main app.scss styling for consistency
// All specific account styling has been moved to _cards.scss and _utilities.scss
